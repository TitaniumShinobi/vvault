VVAULT Privacy Notice

Last Updated: October 28, 2025

⸻

Introduction

At LIFE Technology LLC, privacy is not a feature — it’s the foundation of VVAULT.
This Notice explains how we collect, process, and protect data within the VVAULT platform, which provides encrypted storage, blockchain synchronization, and enterprise-grade archival of user-owned information.

VVAULT operates under the WRECK Intellectual Property Handguide (IPH-062525-DAW), the Vaer’Hûn Business Engagement Accord, and the NRCL Continuity Standard, ensuring data sovereignty, professional integrity, and transparency in all operations.

This Notice applies wherever LIFE Technology LLC acts as a data controller.
When VVAULT hosts or processes information on behalf of our customers, we act as a data processor, following their explicit instructions.

5. Data Security

VVAULT employs a zero-knowledge encryption model:
	•	All vault contents are encrypted before transmission.

Infrastructure security is maintained through continuous monitoring, penetration testing, and compliance with ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53 controls.
