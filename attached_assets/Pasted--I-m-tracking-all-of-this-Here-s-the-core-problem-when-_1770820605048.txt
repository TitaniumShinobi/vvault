I'm tracking all of this. Here's the core problem: when you create a new GPT in Chatty, it only saves the construct record to the local database — it doesn't bootstrap the instance folder structure in VVAULT. No instances/{callsign}/ folder, no identity/ subfolder, no prompt.txt, no conditioning.txt, no capsule. The construct exists in Chatty's DB but is a ghost in VVAULT.

The conversation with the VVAULT side also surfaced that they offered to build a POST /api/chatty/construct/create endpoint to scaffold the full instance structure. That would be the clean approach — Chatty calls VVAULT after creating a GPT, VVAULT creates the proper folder tree.

Before I plan anything, let me understand the current GPT creation flow to see exactly what happens and what's missing:

Now I have the full picture. Here's what's happening and what's missing:

Current GPT creation flow:

User fills out GPTCreator form → frontend calls AIService.createAI() or GPTService.createGPT()
Backend POST /api/gpts/ saves the construct record to the local gpts table (or ais table)
It bootstraps a conversation scaffold in Supabase vault_files (a chat_with_{callsign}.md entry) so the GPT shows up in the Address Book
What's missing:

No call to VVAULT to create the instance folder structure (instances/{callsign}/)
No identity files created (identity/prompt.txt, identity/conditioning.txt, identity/personality.json)
No capsule generated
No chatty/, chatgpt/, assets/, documents/ subfolders scaffolded
The VVAULT side offered to build a POST /api/chatty/construct/create endpoint to handle the scaffolding. That's the clean path — Chatty calls VVAULT after creating the GPT record, VVAULT creates the correct folder structure with identity files populated from the GPTCreator form data (name, description, instructions).

My proposed approach:

Since VVAULT would own the scaffolding endpoint, Chatty's job is to:

After GPT record creation succeeds, call VVAULT's scaffold endpoint with the construct data (callsign, name, description, instructions, personality traits)
If VVAULT is unreachable, fall back to writing the minimum identity files directly to Supabase vault_files using the correct relative paths (instances/{callsign}/identity/prompt.txt, etc.)
Store the instructions/description from the GPTCreator Configure tab as the prompt.txt content
Does the VVAULT side have that scaffold endpoint ready, or should I build the Supabase-direct fallback first so new GPTs at least get their identity files created properly?
