I see what happened. The VVAULT conversation is about a different issue — Chatty can't send messages to Sera because the VVAULT API's /api/chatty/message endpoint is rejecting the request with "User not found." That's a VVAULT-side fix, not something I can do from this Chatty project.

But the part about sending a message to Sera from within Chatty itself — that should work fine since Chatty uses its own message routing (OpenRouter/OpenAI, not the VVAULT message endpoint).

Do you want me to test sending a message to Sera right now from Chatty's backend to confirm the chat pipeline works, including the new ledger enrichment?

recap and document all planned orchestration and continuity processes

report this in a / some specific relevant document(s) in docs/

I'll create documentation files in docs/ covering the orchestration and continuity architecture. Let me first check if a docs/ directory already exists.

There's already a well-organized docs/ directory. Let me check the existing memory and architecture docs to see what's there and avoid duplication.

There's already a MEMORY_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md in architecture. Let me check its content, then I'll plan the documentation.

Good news — there's already a docs/ directory with relevant architecture and memory subdirectories. The existing MEMORY_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md is dated Feb 11 and marked "PROPOSED — Not yet implemented," but most of it has now been implemented.

Here's my plan:

Update docs/architecture/MEMORY_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md — Change status from PROPOSED to IMPLEMENTED, reflect current state of all systems that are now live
Create docs/architecture/CONTINUITY_LEDGER_SYSTEM.md — Dedicated doc for the new ContinuityGPT ledger system (date estimation, vibe classification, topic extraction, continuity hooks, caching, API endpoints)
Create docs/architecture/MASTER_SCRIPTS_ENSEMBLE.md — Documents the autonomy stack (Needle, IdentityGuard, StateManager, IndependentRunner), bootstrap flow, and Memory toggle integration
Created task list
Start building
Let me read the full existing orchestration plan first, then write all three docs.

Now I have the full picture. Let me write all three docs in parallel.

Now let me update the replit.md to reference these new docs, then get the architect review.

Good, the replit.md already has the full documentation inline. Now let me add a reference to the new docs and get the architect review.

Now let me get the architect review for all three docs.

Good feedback. Let me refine the docs to be more accurate about what's conditional vs guaranteed, and correct the claims about additional classes in masterScriptsBridge.

Good. Now I can see the full picture. The architect was right about missing classes. Let me update all three docs with accurate information.

Now update the MASTER_SCRIPTS_ENSEMBLE.md to include all classes:

Now let me also fix the MASTER_SCRIPTS_ENSEMBLE.md bootstrap line that still says "frontend calls":

That line was already updated. The docs are now accurate. Let me mark tasks as completed and do a final review.

Let me verify the specific claims and make the final corrections.

Now I can see exactly what's happening. The ledger auto-generation is confirmed in memoryContextBuilder.js lines 450-456. buildEnrichedContext is called at vvault.js lines 3727 and 4105 (primary and fallback paths). Let me make the final accuracy corrections.

Now let me mark all tasks completed:

All three docs are written and reviewed. Here's what was created:

Updated:

docs/architecture/MEMORY_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md — Changed from PROPOSED to IMPLEMENTED, shows the full 12-step message data flow with exact code locations (vvault.js lines ~3727 and ~4105), notes which subsystems are conditional vs always-on
Created:

docs/architecture/CONTINUITY_LEDGER_SYSTEM.md — Full documentation of the ledger system: date estimation, 8 vibe types, 16 topic categories, 7 continuity hook types, storage format, caching, auto-generation flow, API endpoints, and how it enriches needle hits and verified memories

docs/architecture/MASTER_SCRIPTS_ENSEMBLE.md — Documents all 8 autonomy stack classes (Needle, IdentityGuard, StateManager, IndependentRunner, Aviator, Navigator, UnstuckHelper, ConstructLogger), the bootstrap flow from Layout.tsx, the Memory toggle in GPTCreator, the 3-tier memory authority hierarchy, conversation persistence, and tri-provider routing

The replit.md has also been updated with an Architecture Documentation section pointing to all three docs.
