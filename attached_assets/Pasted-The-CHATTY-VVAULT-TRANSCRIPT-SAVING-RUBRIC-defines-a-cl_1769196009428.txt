The CHATTY_VVAULT_TRANSCRIPT_SAVING_RUBRIC defines a clean architecture:

Single append-only markdown file per construct at instances/{construct-001}/chatty/chat_with_{construct-001}.md
Immediate writes before UI shows "sent"
No new .txt shards - everything in consolidated markdown
Headers with metadata, chronological blocks, ISO timestamps
Files Created for Transcript Uploads
Backend:

server/routes/transcripts.js - API for saving transcripts to Supabase with VVAULT path structure (vvault/users/shard_0000/{userId}/instances/{constructId}/{source}/{filename})
Frontend (in GPTCreator.tsx):

Transcript source dropdown (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Copilot, Claude, Chai, Character.AI, DeepSeek, Other)
Upload button with staging
Dynamic file count badge
Files for GPT Seat Connection Attempts
server/lib/capsuleIntegration.js - Loads transcript data from instance directories (loadTranscriptData())
server/lib/unifiedIntelligenceOrchestrator.js - Has getRelevantContext() for searching transcripts
server/lib/gptRuntimeBridge.js - Routes GPT messages through orchestrator
server/services/hybridMemoryService.js - Wrapper for memup integration
Do We Need All 3 Memory Systems?
Short answer: No. Here's the breakdown:

System	Location	Status	Needed for Chatty?
chatgpt-retrieval-plugin	frame™	Semantic search with embeddings	❌ No - requires separate infrastructure
memup	frame™	Production-ready but needs Python + local ChromaDB	⚠️ Optional - adds complexity
Chatty custom scripts	capsuleIntegration, MemoryRetrievalEngine	Works, loads transcripts	✅ Yes - simplest path
Recommendation: Use only the Chatty custom scripts (capsuleIntegration.js). They already:

Load transcripts from VVAULT path structure
Parse and index conversations
Search for relevant context via getRelevantContext()
The missing piece is just routing that context to actual LLM calls instead of hardcoded template responses. The VVAULT already has your master identity scripts - we just need to connect them.

Next step: Connect GPT seats to linChat.js with:

User identity injection (from VVAULT)
Transcript context from getRelevantContext()
Replace template responses with actual LLM calls
