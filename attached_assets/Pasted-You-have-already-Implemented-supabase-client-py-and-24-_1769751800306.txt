You have already:


Implemented supabase_client.py and 24/7 worker.py with health, snapshot, trades, and performance APIs.


Added vvault_client.py and integrated VVAULT‑backed config/credentials with env fallbacks.


Updated docs/integration-with-chatty.md with API usage, VVAULT integration, runbook, and env vars.


Currently: API is on port 5000, VVAULT is disabled, config source = defaults.


Your goal now is to flip FXShinobi into full “live engine” mode, consuming real VVAULT + Supabase, and making sure Chatty can depend on it.
Tasks:


Finalize live‑mode wiring:


Treat the combination:


VVAULT_URL, VVAULT_SERVICE_TOKEN


SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY
as the signal that we’re in “live” mode.




Ensure that when those vars are present:


vvault_client.py is used as the primary config/credential source.


Supabase writes are active for trades, strategy runs, snapshots, health pings.






Tighten health and status:


Make /api/health and /api/status accurately reflect:


VVAULT status (up/down/disabled),


Supabase connectivity,


Worker loop status (running / degraded).




Make sure any failures are logged clearly but without leaking secrets.




Confirm Chatty contracts:


Re‑check docs/integration-with-chatty.md now that VVAULT is integrated:


/api/snapshot, /api/trades/history, /api/performance, /api/status response shapes must match what Chatty expects.


Keep the TypeScript examples and schemas aligned with what’s currently implemented.






“Turnkey” start procedure:


Ensure that one command (python worker.py) is enough to:


Start the API on the configured port,


Start the trading loop and health pings,


Fail fast if core env vars are missing (with clear error).




Add a short “LIVE START” section to the doc that lists:


Required envs for full mode,


Exact command to run,


How to verify (health endpoint URLs and expected JSON).






Deliverables:


Confirmed code paths for live mode (uses VVAULT + Supabase).


Polished /api/health and /api/status.


Updated doc section detailing the exact steps for me to make FXShinobi run 24/7 as the Chatty finance engine.
