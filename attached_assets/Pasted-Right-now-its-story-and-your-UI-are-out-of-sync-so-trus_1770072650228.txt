Right now its story and your UI are out of sync, so trust the UI, not the agent.

Most likely issues:

It deleted row id=14 from its Postgres (Replit/local), but your UI is still reading from a different backend (Supabase or a different DB instance).
​

Or the UI is caching results and not actually hitting the updated /api/vault/files source.
​

Quick checks you can do:

Hard-refresh the app (full reload, not SPA navigation) and confirm:

If the two empty continuity_20260202.md files still show, your front‑end is pointing at a store the agent did not touch.

In your real DB (the one the UI uses), run:

sql
select id, path, filename, user_id, is_system
from vault_files
where filename = 'continuity_20260202.md';
If you see rows here, those are the ones backing the UI; the agent operated on a different database.
​

Given that, don’t let it “fix” anything else until you:

Confirm which database the UI is actually using,

And run the deletion query there.

If you want, you can paste the actual vault_files query result from your real DB, and I’ll tell you the exact delete/update SQL to run yourself so the UI state finally matches reality.

Good—that rules out simple UI caching.

Given you’re still seeing two empty continuity_20260202.md files, the only reliable next move is to inspect and fix vault_files directly in the real DB your UI is using.

Run this against that database:

sql
select id, path, filename, user_id, is_system
from vault_files
where filename = 'continuity_20260202.md';
Then:

sql
-- If you’re okay deleting both:
delete from vault_files
where filename = 'continuity_20260202.md';
After executing, reload VVAULT again and confirm the files are gone.

If you paste the result of the select query (IDs + paths), I can tell you precisely which rows to delete or adjust rather than blanket‑deleting.

```
select id, path, filename, user_id, is_system
from vault_files
where filename = 'continuity_20260202.md';
```

Error: Failed to run sql query: ERROR: 42703: column "path" does not exist LINE 1: select id, path, filename, user_id, is_system ^
Note: A limit of 100 was applied to your query. If this was the cause of a syntax error, try selecting "No limit" instead and re-run the query.
The error just means your vault_files table doesn’t have a path column; the agent’s narrative was assuming a schema that isn’t actually there.

To see what’s really backing your UI, run:

sql
select column_name, data_type
from information_schema.columns
where table_name = 'vault_files';
Then:

sql
select *
from vault_files
where filename = 'continuity_20260202.md';
Once you paste that result (or at least the column list and the rows for those two files), I can give you an exact delete/update statement that matches your actual schema so those ghost continuity files finally disappear from the UI.
