Here's my approach:

Remove Aurora from any hardcoded seed data — she shouldn't exist unless added through the GUI
Integrate the new VVAULT files endpoint — call GET /api/chatty/construct/<construct_id>/files to load real identity data (prompt.json for name/description/instructions, avatar) and real knowledge file listings (assets/ + documents/)
Update the GPT Configure tab so it reads from this real data instead of fabricated defaults
Ensure empty states — if a construct has no data in Supabase, show empty fields, not made-up content
Let me first check what exactly needs to change before writing the task list.

Now I can see the full scope. Let me also check how identity data should be loaded from VVAULT:

Now I have a clear picture. Here's my plan:

The core problem: The seedDefaultConstructs() method in gptManager.js hardcodes fabricated names, descriptions, and instructions for Zen, Katana, Lin, and Aurora — and inserts them into the local SQLite database as seed data. The GPT Configure tab then reads from that local DB, showing made-up content instead of the real identity data living in Supabase.

The fix:

Remove Aurora from the seed constructs — only Zen, Lin, and Katana should be seeded (Zen and Lin as system nav items, Katana as a custom GPT). Aurora gets added only through the GUI.

Strip fabricated identity from seeds — the seed data should only contain the minimum needed to register a construct (callsign, ID, model defaults, orchestration mode). Name, description, and instructions should be left empty so they get loaded from Supabase.

Add VVAULT identity hydration — after seeding, call the new GET /api/chatty/construct/<construct_id>/files endpoint to fetch real identity data (prompt.json) from VVAULT/Supabase, and populate name/description/instructions from that.

Wire up knowledge files — the GPT Configure tab's knowledge section should pull file listings from the VVAULT files endpoint (assets/ + documents/ folders) instead of local data.

Remove Aurora from ConstructRegistry — clean up all Aurora references from the registry and related services.
