Here’s exactly what to tell the Replit agent for VVAULT.

***

You are the Replit agent for **VVAULT**.  
Two `continuity_20260202.md` files now appear in my UI under my user root, both empty.  
Fix this in two phases: cleanup, then regenerate a proper report.

***

## Phase 1 – Cleanup the bad continuity files

1. **Identify the bad rows**

   - Query `vault_files` in the database for my continuity files:

     ```sql
     select id, path, user_id, is_system, content, sha256
     from vault_files
     where path like '%continuity_20260202.md';
     ```

2. **Confirm they are empty artifacts**

   - For each row returned:
     - Check `content` column (if used); if it’s `NULL` or empty, treat as bad.  
     - Check the backing storage object (Supabase or Replit storage) and confirm the file has **zero or near-zero bytes**.

3. **Delete these failed artifacts**

   - Remove the corresponding objects from storage.  
   - Delete or soft‑delete the rows from `vault_files`:

     ```sql
     delete from vault_files
     where path like '%continuity_20260202.md';
     ```

   - Result: after this step, there should be **no** `continuity_20260202.md` files in the DB or storage.

4. **Verify in the UI**

   - Reload the VVAULT UI as Devon.  
   - Under `All Files`, confirm that **no continuity file** appears.  
   - This ensures we’re starting clean.

***

## Phase 2 – Regenerate a single, correct continuity report

1. **Re‑run the Katana continuity regression suite**

   - Use the existing test harness you already wired (the four continuity tests against Katana‑001).  
   - After the tests:

     - Build a markdown report containing:
       - A summary section with PASS/FAIL for each of the 4 tests.  
       - Raw prompts and raw Katana responses for each test.  
       - Timestamp of the run.

2. **Write the report to the canonical path**

   - Use this exact path for the new file:

     ```text
     vvault/users/shard_0000/devon_woodson_1762969514958/instances/katana-001/tests/continuity_20260202.md
     ```

   - Ensure you:

     - Write the **full markdown content** to storage.  
     - Insert or upsert a matching row into `vault_files` with:
       - `path` set to the above.  
       - `user_id = <Devon’s UUID>`.  
       - `is_system = false`.  
       - `sha256` computed from the actual file contents (if you’re using that).  
       - `content` filled with the markdown text *only if* you’re intentionally duplicating it in DB; otherwise leave `content` null and rely on storage.

3. **Do not create duplicates**

   - Before inserting, check if a row already exists for that exact path:

     ```sql
     select id from vault_files
     where path = 'vvault/users/shard_0000/devon_woodson_1762969514958/instances/katana-001/tests/continuity_20260202.md';
     ```

   - If it exists, **update that row** instead of inserting a new one.  
   - There must be **only one** continuity report row for this path.

4. **Verify from the UI**

   - Refresh VVAULT as Devon.  
   - Under `All Files` and/or navigating via:

     `Devon Woodson / instances / katana-001 / tests`

     confirm:

     - Exactly **one** `continuity_20260202.md` is listed.  
     - Opening it in the UI shows the full markdown report (summary + raw transcripts), not an empty file.

***

## Final confirmation

After you complete these steps, generate a short log entry in `replit.md` stating:

- The two empty continuity files were removed (DB + storage).  
- A new continuity report was generated from a fresh test run.  
- The report is stored at the canonical user‑scoped path and confirmed visible with valid content in the VVAULT UI.

Only then consider the continuity report situation resolved.
