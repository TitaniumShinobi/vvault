Zero trust for vvault means every request is authenticated, authorized, scoped, and logged, with **no** implicit trust based on network, tenant, or component.  The core is strong identity, micro-segmentation of data and APIs, and pervasive telemetry tied into policy.

## Core zero trust principles

- **Never trust, always verify**: Every user, service, and job hitting vvault needs explicit authN and authZ every time, even if “inside” trusted infra. [cyberark](https://www.cyberark.com/what-is/nist-sp-800-207-cybersecurity-framework/)
- **Least privilege**: Access is scoped to the minimum fields/collections/operations needed, for the shortest time possible. [zscaler](https://www.zscaler.com/resources/security-terms-glossary/what-is-zero-trust)
- **Assume breach**: Design vvault so a compromised account, pod, or node is contained via segmentation and tight policies. [zeronetworks](https://zeronetworks.com/resource-center/topics/zero-trust-security-a-complete-guide-to-principles-architecture-and-best-practices)

## Identity and access layer

- Use strong identity for humans and workloads: OIDC/SAML for users, OIDC/JWT or short-lived workload identities for services. [phuchoang2603.github](https://phuchoang2603.github.io/posts/gitops-github-actions-hashicorp-vault/)
- Enforce MFA and RBAC/ABAC on all control-plane actions (admin, key management, policy edits) with centralized policy management. [commvault](https://www.commvault.com/explore/how-zero-trust-security-can-help-mitigate-risk)
- Encode tenant- and context-aware policies (tenant id, app id, env, risk signals) for vvault read/write/rotate flows. [revinfotech](https://www.revinfotech.com/blog/multi-tenant-saas-security)

## Data and API segmentation

- Micro-segment vvault data: separate logical stores/namespaces per tenant and per data class (PII, tokens, config, logs) to enforce isolation. [revinfotech](https://www.revinfotech.com/blog/multi-tenant-saas-security)
- Expose vvault through narrow, well-versioned APIs and require fine-grained permissions per endpoint and per secret path/collection. [cyberark](https://www.cyberark.com/what-is/nist-sp-800-207-cybersecurity-framework/)
- Encrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest, with keys protected in a hardened secrets/crypto subsystem and rotated on schedule. [phuchoang2603.github](https://phuchoang2603.github.io/posts/gitops-github-actions-hashicorp-vault/)

## Runtime verification and telemetry

- Continuously validate context on each vvault call (device posture, location, risk score, behavior anomalies) and gate access when risk jumps. [zscaler](https://www.zscaler.com/resources/security-terms-glossary/what-is-zero-trust)
- Centralize logging of all auth decisions, secret accesses, policy changes, and admin actions for real-time monitoring and incident response. [commvault](https://www.commvault.com/explore/how-zero-trust-security-can-help-mitigate-risk)
- Automate responses: auto-revoke tokens, rotate keys, or quarantine tenants/services on suspicious behavior. [commvault](https://www.commvault.com/explore/how-zero-trust-security-can-help-mitigate-risk)

## Practical starting checklist for vvault

- Inventory vvault assets, tenants, secret types, and current trust boundaries. [commvault](https://www.commvault.com/explore/how-zero-trust-security-can-help-mitigate-risk)
- Implement MFA + SSO for operators, strong workload identity for services, and define baseline vvault access policies. [cyberark](https://www.cyberark.com/what-is/nist-sp-800-207-cybersecurity-framework/)
- Add tenant-isolated namespaces, per-tenant policies, full encryption, and instrumentation hooks for monitoring and anomaly detection. [zeronetworks](https://zeronetworks.com/resource-center/topics/zero-trust-security-a-complete-guide-to-principles-architecture-and-best-practices)

If you share how vvault is built now (stack, multi-tenant model, auth in place), a concrete zero trust design for your exact architecture can be laid out.
